        <h1> Hello! </h1>
        <p>
            I am an Angular developer with several years of experience in building robust and scalable web
            applications.
            I have a strong understanding of the Angular framework, including the latest version of Angular as well as
            previous
            versions.

            I am proficient in developing complex front-end features, implementing state management using tools such as
            NgRx,
            and integrating with back-end services through RESTful APIs.

            In addition to my technical skills, I am also experienced in working in Agile development environments and
            collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software on time.

            I am passionate about keeping up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies, and I
            strive to
            continuously improve my skills to deliver the best possible solutions for my clients or employer.
